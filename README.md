# Lankapuri

*Lankapuri* is a project to modernise two legacy Grantha typefaces.

## History

In the late 1990s, Sri. S. Kunchithapatha Kurukkal, Sri. K. Harihara Sarma & Sri. K. I. Skandadasan created two Grantha typefaces, Kunchithapatham and Ganapathy. A few years later, they released a newer typeface, Kurukkal, superseding Ganapathy. In 2020, Sri. Vinodh Rajan suggested converting these Unicode with the right OpenType layout tables. This project is the result of that, with permission from Sri. Skandadasan. Kunchithapatham and Kurukkal are now ready for use in all modern applications.
